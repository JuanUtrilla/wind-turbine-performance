**A data-driven framework to monitor wind turbine performance, simulate yaw misalignment faults, and prioritize O&M actions using Machine Learning.**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a complete **End-to-End Pipeline** for detecting Yaw Misalignment and underperformance in wind turbines using synthetic SCADA data.

Detecting yaw misalignment (when the turbine is not pointing directly into the wind) is critical for maximizing energy production and reducing mechanical stress. This repository contains a physics-based simulation engine calibrated for a **Vestas V90 2MW turbine** that generates realistic operational data, injects stochastic faults, and trains an **XGBoost Classifier** to identify underperforming assets.

### 📉 Visualizing the Anomaly
The system automatically detects the characteristic "shift to the right" in the Power Curve caused by aerodynamic efficiency loss.

⚙️ How It Works
1. Data Simulation (Physics-Based)
Instead of relying on proprietary/confidential data, this project uses a custom simulation engine (01_data_generator.R) that creates 10-minute SCADA data considering:

Weibull Wind Distributions: Realistic wind speed probabilities.

Spatial Correlation: Wake effects and turbulence intensity.

Fault Injection: Randomly assigns yaw offsets (mild to severe) to specific turbines.

Curtailment & Noise: Simulates real-world sensor noise and grid curtailment events.

2. Machine Learning Pipeline
Problem: Binary Classification (Healthy vs. Underperforming).

Algorithm: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).

Feature Engineering:

Calculates delta_theoretical (deviation from OEM power curve).

Analyzes variance and bandwidth usage.

Performance: The model typically achieves an AUC > 0.95 on unseen test turbines.

3. Automated Reporting
The 02_report_generator.Rmd script knits the results into a professional PDF executive summary, including:

Executive KPIs.

Visual inspection of power curves.

Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves.
